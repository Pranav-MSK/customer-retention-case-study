# Customer Retention Case Study — Ask Stage

This case study is part of my **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate journey**. It applies the first step of the data analysis process — **Ask** — to a real-world-inspired business challenge.

## Business Challenge

**Scenario**: ShopSmart, a fictional online retail company, has noticed that a large percentage of its customers only make a single purchase and do not return. This impacts long-term revenue and increases marketing costs, since acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

Challenge: to understand why customers are not returning and to frame clear questions that will guide future data analysis.

## Stakeholders
Identifying stakeholders helps clarify what information is needed for analysis. It ensures the final results meet the goals of everyone involved.

* **Executive team** — They are concerned with overall revenue and profitability of the business.
* **Marketing team** — They want to design effective campaigns and advertisements to increase customer retention.
* **Operations team** — They are responsible for delivery speed and reliability, which may influence customer satisfaction.
* **Customer support team** — They are the customer-facing team and deal with complaints, service quality issues etc.
* **Customers** — Prime focus of the analysis. They seek good value products, fast delivery, and a smooth shopping experience. Solving their problems will fix the issues faced by the rest of the stakeholders.

## SMART Objective
The **SMART** Framework enables us to **ASK** the right questions necessary to solve the problem statement or business challenge. These questions are:- 

* **S - Specific**: Identify which factors (delivery, support, loyalty program, etc.) most influence repeat purchases.
* **M - Measurable**: Increase the percentage of customers making a repeat purchase within 90 days.
* **A - Action-Oriented**: Provide marketing and operations with insights to improve retention strategies.
* **R - Relevant**: Retaining customers directly increases revenue and reduces acquisition costs.
* **T - Time-Bound**: Achieve a 10% increase in repeat purchase rate within the next 12 months.

Now, using the answers gathered from answering the SMART questions, let us frame an appropriate question.

**Framed Question:**

> *“How can ShopSmart increase its repeat purchase rate within 90 days by at least 10% over the next 12 months, and which customer segments should we target to achieve this?”*

We have used all the SMART questions to frame this question.

## Setting the Stage for the Next Step (Prepare)

To answer this question, the following data would be useful:

* Transaction history (purchase frequency, order dates, amounts).
* Customer demographics (age, location, etc.).
* Delivery performance (average delivery times, delays).
* Support interactions (complaints, ticket counts).
* Loyalty program membership data.

This data will be collected, cleaned, and validated in the **Prepare** stage.

## Communication Plan

* **Executives**: Share a concise one-page summary highlighting the challenge, objective, and key question.
* **Marketing & Operations**: Hold a kickoff meeting to align on goals and confirm the data required.
* **Analytics team**: Provide a more detailed project brief (including this case study) to guide the next steps.

## Reflection

This case study demonstrates the importance of the **ASK** step in analytics. Clearly defining the business challenge, aligning stakeholders, and setting a SMART objective lays the foundation for effective data analysis.
